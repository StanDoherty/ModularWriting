The sources for this web site live at [GitHub ModularWriting](https://github.com/StanDoherty/ModularWriting). I invite thinkers, teachers, and practitioners to review the arguments here and consider joining the conversation. Some of the questions that shape the discussion are:

1. What do we mean by "modular writing" or "modular information"?
2. How many faces or shapes has it taken over the years -- poetry? rhetorical oratory? medieval chant? DITA? chatbots? conversational AI?
3. Do these various implementations reveal any recurring themes or common denominators? 
4. Do the most successful practitioners exhibit any particular or unusual skills?

The oral poet makes no conscious effort to break the traditional phrases and incidents; he is forced by the rapidity of composition in performance to use these traditional elements. . . . His art consists not so much in learning through repetition the time-worn formulas as in the ability to compose and recompose the phrases for the idea of the moment.  
- Pg 5. Albert B. Lord The Singer of Tales, 3d ed. 2019

We have been given a bare statement of the council theme, with which the song opens. The theme ends with the suggestion by the wise councilor that the Sultan send to Bosnia for Derdeliz Alija and the Bosnian armies, a suggestion which is accepted, and a messenger is sent with  letter to the hero. This is the framework on which the singer will build. Although he thinks of the theme as a unit, it can be broken down into smaller parts; the receipt of the letter, the summoning of the council, and so forth. Yet these are subsidiary to the larger theme. They will be useful perhaps in other contexts later on, but the singer learns them first for use in the specific council of the specific song, with the appropriate names of people and places and their characteristics.

Our concept of the "original", of the "song" simply makes no sense in oral tradition. To us it seems so basic, so logical, since we are brought up in a society in which writing has fixed the norm of a stable first creation in art, we feel that there must be an "original" for everything. . . . It follows, then, that we cannot correctly speak of a "variant," since there is no "original" to be varied! Yet songs are related to one another in varying degrees; not, however, in relationship of variant to original.

The act that the same song occurs attached to different heroes would seem to indicate that the story is more important than the historical hero to which it is attached. There is a close relationship between the hero and the tale, but with some tales at least the *type* of hero is more significant than the *specific* hero. It is convenient to group songs according to their try content, or thematic configurations, because songs seem to continue in spite of the particular historical hero; they are not connected irrevocably to any single hero. If we classify songs by their content, we find a number of well-defined categories: weddings, rescues, returns, and captures of cities.

The word "morphology" means the study of forms. In botany, the term "morphology" means the study of the component parts of a plant, of their relationship to each other and to the whole -- in other words, the study of the plant's structure. . . . It is possible to make an examination of the forms of the tale which will be as exact as the morphology of organic formations.

Vladimir Propp, the Morphology of the Folk Tale 2nd e. 1994.

We are undertaking a comparison of the themes of these tales. For the sake of comparison we shall separate the component parts of fairy tales y special methods; and then, we shall make a comparison of the tales according to their components. The result will be a morphology (i.e. a description of the tale according to its component parts  and relationship of these components to each other and to the whole.

Propp developed a notation to categorize each recurring narrative "form" (A B C D) and variations of that "form" occurring in different versions of a fairy tale. Here is a diagram capturing variations in two "struggle-victory" tales. The first contains "forms" narrating the killing of an enemy without a fight, the second with a fight.

Expressed as a single "schema" for both "struggle-victory" tales, we see the central sequence of "forms" branch and merge.

Examining princess-abduction tales, Propp concludes, "the entire store of fairy tales ought to be examined as a *chain* of variants. Were we able to unfold the picture of transformations, it would be possible to satisfy ourselves that all of the tales given can be morpohologically deduced from the tales about the kidnapping of a princess by a dragon -- from that form which we are inclined to consider basic.
